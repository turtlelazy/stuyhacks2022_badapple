## How do use to computer itself (opening the .dig files)
First you need to download Digital logic sim: https://github.com/hneemann/Digital

After setting it up, there are 2 .dig files inside of the directory Digital

BadApple.dig - The computer modified to play "Bad Apple!"
  -> If you want to speed up the video, increase the clock frequency
  -> Loading the badapple.hex into the 5 ROMS (top to bottom) will load the data.

YU1v2.dig - The original computer without modificiations
  -> By editing the ROM (the one next to the RAM) you can write small programs for this computer
  -> If you address a value above 32767, you will acsess RAM. Below that value are addresses to ROM.
  
 OPCODES can be found in OPCODES.py
 Running OPCODES.py will write to a file that contains the opcode data that the computer uses.
